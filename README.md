**Heimdallr** stands watch over my homelab from the modest hardware of a Pi Zero.

It runs:
- A **Power-on-Server script** to boot sleeping devices and ping key IPs and log their status to a file or local dashboard on command.
- An **Auto Update script** to keep your OS updated.

### ⚡ Wake-on-LAN/Uptime Logger

To wake a device add your MAC addresses and IP addresses into the script:

```bash
bash scripts/power-on-server.sh
```
This will also pings your critical devices every 45 minutes if you schedule this via cron:

```bash
# Wake-on-LAN        
    45 * * * * bash /home/${USER}/power-on-server.sh >> /home/${USER}/logs/power-on-server.log
        # run "power-on-server.sh" every hour at *:45 am/pm
    30 0 * * 1 /bin/bash -c 'find /home/${USER}/logs -name "power-on-server.log" -exec sh -c "cp {} /home/${USER}/backup_logs/\$(date +\%Y\%m\%d)-\$(basename {})" \; -exec rm {} \;'
        # saves weekly version of "power-on-server.log" on Monday of every week at 00:30 am then deletes the old log
```

Log output is stored in logs/power-on-server.log and backup_logs/power-on-server.log or can be adapted to report to an API or dashboard.

### 🕒 Auto Updater

This script will update, upgrade, and clean up:

```bash
bash scripts/apt-get-autoupdater.sh
```

To auto update your device, schedule this via cron:

```bash
# OS-Auto-Updater
    5 2 * * 0 bash /home/${USER}/apt-get-autoupdater.sh >> /home/${USER}/logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log
        # execute automatic update script and log every sunday at 02:05 am
    1 0 1 * * /bin/bash -c 'find /home/${USER}/logs -name "apt-get-autoupdater.log" -exec sh -c "cp {} /home/${USER}/backup_logs/\$(date +\%Y\%m\%d)-\$(basename {})" \; -exec rm {} \;'
        # saves monthly version of "apt-get-autoupdater.log" on the 1st of every month at 00:01 am then deletes the old log
```

Log output is stored in logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log and backup_logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log or can be adapted to report to an API or dashboard.
